# Stock App
## AIMs:
The goal of this project was to create a simple webpage to check the values of stocks in real-time. It uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript using NODE.js as framework to set a dynamic web application, given the dynamic fluctuation of the stock market. The page uses semantic HTML elements and is a responsive website across different screen sizes. A gray color palette was chosen for this project using the Bootstrap framework version v5.1.3. The main aim is to allow the user to check the stock's value in a clean and straight.
